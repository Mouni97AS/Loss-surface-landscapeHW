# Loss-surface-landscapeHW

the repository related to my homework visualizing the loss surface landscape.
Pytorch implementation of Convolutional neural network for visualizing the loss surfac. The project done on google Colab (provide a GPU for training the model).
I have done the project in two different datasets. big datasets consist of traffic signs of 52 classes, and the Mnist handwritten
